#Design Prototypes with a Real Database
This template enables you to quickly spin up a new application that is powered by a real database. This allows you to not only separate data from your design, but also gives you persistent data with which you can create multi-screen prototypes and workflows.

### Notes
- This prototype does not have database authentication, which means that anyone with access to your firebase_URL can read and write to your entire database. Probably fine for prototyping purposes, but be wary of using sensitive data.
- This prototype has basic authentication via Staticfile.auth. The default user/password is admin/admin. To generate your own encrypted password, use http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator

##Steps to Reproduce
+ Open terminal
+ Clone or download repo to your local machine
+ Navigate into your new repository via terminal
+ Start a simple server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

+ Spin up new Firebase Project : https://firebase.google.com/
+ Insert new Firebase Database URL into index.html placeholders for both read and write access.
+ Configure Firebase DB Rules to the following to allow read/write access: 
    ```
    {
      "rules": {
        ".read": "auth == null",
        ".write": "auth == null"
      }
    }
    ```

+ Test connection to DB by adding a new task and seeing the task inside your Firebase console
